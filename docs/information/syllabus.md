# Syllabus

## Description

The web is arguably today's most important application platform. Web browsers run on practically every device, and even many phone applications are in fact web applications under the covers. This course will cover a broad range of client-side web technologies, including HTTP itself, HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript; it will additionally cover key concepts for the server side of web applications, including key value stores and SQL servers. This course will also cover key concepts and technologies including AJAX, JavaScript libraries (e.g., jQuery), and web security. This course is hands-on and heavily project-based; students will construct a substantial dynamic web application based on the concepts, technologies, and techniques presented during lectures and in readings. This course satisfies the IE Requirement.

## Prerequisites

COMPSCI 220 (or 230) with a grade of C or better, or INFO 248 and COMPSCI 186/187, with a grade of C or better in each. This course assumes a good understanding of programming at the 187 (data structure implementation) or 186 level (using data structures), basic command line usage, understanding of version control systems (e.g., git), and object-oriented programming concepts and techniques are helpful. Previous JavaScript background, while not required, is also helpful. We also assume a level of maturity for success in working in a team-based environment.

## Statement of Inclusivity

The staff for this course support the UMass commitment to diversity, and welcome individuals regardless of age, background, citizenship, disability, sex, education, ethnicity, family status, gender, gender identity, geographical origin, language, military experience, political views, race, religion, sexual orientation, socioeconomic status, and work experience. In this course, each voice in the classroom has something of value to contribute. Please take care to respect the different experiences, beliefs and values expressed by students and staff involved in this course.

## Required Text

No required text. All material will be provided through lectures notes, slides, examples, code, and any other resources deemed as relevant to the topics covered in this course.

## Course Development Environment

Given that this is a programming intensive course, it is important to highlight the development environment! Generally, most of what we cover in this course is available on all the typical operating systems. However, the team project allows you to explore additional environments that may have specific OS requirements. You are welcome to use those additional libraries/tools; however, you will not receive direct support for what you use. It is your responsibility for the installation, setup, and use of those additional components. You are welcome to use any editor, IDE, or tools to explore this material. We strongly recommend that you use [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

## Other Material

It is assumed that you have a computer to use for assignments in this course. You should make sure to commit your work frequently to GitHub. We will not accept excuses for missing or accidental deletion of work. You may only use GitHub for storing your work on individual assignments if you are using a private repository. Use of public repositories to store assignment solutions on GitHub is considered cheating and will result in a failure for this course. You will be required to store and share your team project work on a public repo!

## Learning Outcomes

After this course, students will be able to:

- Apply HTML to structure content rendered in a browser
- Apply CSS to style content in a browser to enhance the usability of an application
- Apply the JavaScript programming language to solve problems in a web environment
- Apply the fundamental architecture of a front-end web application
- Apply the fundamental architecture of a back-end web application
- Apply the connection between front-end and back-end
- Apply a RESTful web application
- Apply the fundamental construction of a modern and complete web application

## Integrative Experience

This course satisfies the Integrative Experience (IE) requirement. The upper-division integrative experience provides a structured context for students to reflect on their own learning and explore the connections between the broad exposure provided by General Education and the more focused exposure of their major. You can read additional details on the integrative experience website. The IE requirement is fulfilled by this course through the application of extensive team-based learning. Furthermore, this course embraces the IE through a substantial team project that is entirely student driven and explicitly integrates the material covered in this course with the experiences, learning, and knowledge attained by every unique person enrolled in this course.

## Course Format

### Hybrid

This course uses a hybrid model. There are two different sections of the course that meet on Tuesdays and Thursdays respectively. You are expected to attend in person the section that you are enrolled in. During the section that you are not enrolled in, you are expected to attend on Zoom. If you have a conflict with the time of the other section, you are then expected to watch the recording of the class on your own time and complete any activity that was introduced during class. If you attend on Zoom, you will be able to ask questions by posting to the messaging system.

### Lectures

Lectures will be led by the professor and provide a high-level overview of the course material. The presentation format will include a variety of slides, written notes, programming examples, activities, etc. All material will be available through the course learning management system site or website. You are expected to attend every lecture for your section and arrive promptly so you do not disturb others. You may use electronic devices during class, however, its use must pertain to the activity at hand. If your use of an electronic device is distracting to yourself or others, you will be asked to turn the device off.

**What happens if I can’t attend a lecture in person?**

Although we want you to attend the lecture for your section in person, we understand that sometimes that isn’t always possible. For that reason, we provide flexible options that allow you to participate.

- **Remote Synchronous:** attend the lecture remotely on Zoom and ask questions through the messaging system.
- **Asynchronous:** watch the recorded lecture at a time that is convenient for you.

### Lab

The Lab section is led by teaching assistants (TAs) for this course. There will also be undergraduate course assistants (UCA) assigned to your lab section. You are expected to attend every lab section. Labs are used to begin lab exercises in groups as well as to work on the end of semester project. Missing a lab section does not excuse you from any activities that occur during that time. Do not ask to make up any missed work during lab section time.

**What happens if I can’t attend a lab in person?**

Although we want you to attend labs in person, we understand that sometimes that isn’t always possible. For that reason, we provide flexible options that allow you to participate.

- **Remote Synchronous:** attend the lab remotely on Zoom and ask questions through the messaging system.
- **Asynchronous:** labs will not be recorded, however, you must still complete the lab activity by the assigned due date.

## Rules for Success

### Student Responsibilities

If you follow these rules, your odds of learning the material and achieving a good grade in this course will improve greatly.

- Read the assignment documentation early and carefully.
- Do your work on time, submit your work on time, and make sure you submitted the correct work.
- Communicate with other students in the course, the professor, and other course staff for help.
- Be honest in the work you do and the submissions you make.
- Communicate with me and others in the course with respect and understanding.
- Do not ask to submit assignments after the due date.

### Instructor Responsibilities

You can expect from us:

- Timely release of course assignments.
- Timely release of scores achieved on course assignments.
- To respond to questions in the discussion forums in a reasonable amount of time during the week and normal working hours.
- Be respectful of your ideas and value the diversity you bring to the virtual classroom.
- Be open to dialogue that challenges me.
- Be present during my stated office hours.
- Ensure the proper running of the course.

## Grading Policy

The anticipated breakdown of course grades is as follows; this is subject to change.

- In-Class Exercises (15%)
- Labs (15%)
- Homework (40%)
- Team Project (30%)

### Grading Notes

- The numerical cutoff for final course letter grade assignment will be made after all grading is completed. As a rough guide, expect to require at least a 93 to get an A, a 90 to get an A-, an 87 to get a B+, an 83 to get a B, an 80 to get a B-, etc.
- Individual projects/assignments/labs will not be scaled (curved).
- The instructor may or may not choose to scale final grades.
- Final grades are assigned based on the overall weighted average as defined by the grading policy. Grades will be rounded up. For example, if you achieve an 89.93 then the final letter grade will be (for example) an A-, not a B+.

### Ungrading

[Ungrading](https://www.jessestommel.com/ungrading-an-faq/), also known as assessment without grades, is a radical form of assessment that shifts the focus from evaluating students' performance based on numerical scores to fostering their learning and growth. In an ungraded environment, teachers provide regular and ongoing feedback to students on their progress and learning, rather than assigning a final grade at the end of a course or assignment. This approach empowers students to take ownership of their learning by encouraging them to set their own goals, reflect on their progress, and engage in self-assessment. By removing the pressure of grades, students are able to take risks, be creative, and collaborate with their peers, leading to deeper and more meaningful learning experiences. Additionally, ungrading can help to reduce the stress and anxiety that students often experience in a traditional graded environment and foster a positive learning culture in the classroom.

This course uses ungrading. In short, the responsibility of the grade you achieve in this course is up to you. You will submit grades that you believed you achieved on each and every assignment in this course including the final project and final grade. We will choose at random some number of submissions where we will provide feedback, but no grade. You will be asked to submit an extensive self-reflection at two points during the semester on your own learning and evidence that supports that learning. We will evaluate these submissions and how they relate to your chosen grade to determine accuracy.

At the end of the course, you will submit a grade that you believe accurately reflects your learning in this course. The instructor reserves the right to make modifications to your grade based on your submissions and reflections. 

This form of grading provides grade freedom and ownership in your own learning. If used wisely, you have the opportunity to learn without grade stress and experience a learning environment that is free and open. We trust that you will use this freedom to explore the course material and beyond in ways in which you may not have been able to otherwise.

> "The path to true learning lies not in grades but in the journey of self-discovery. Let go of the pressure, and the knowledge will come." - Yoda

## Assignments

### Exercises

Most classes will provide time to begin exercises that will apply your understanding of the material being discussed in lecture. You are required to complete participation exercises by the stated deadline. If you are unable to attend class you are still expected to submit the activity by the deadline. They are due on the day of the next class by midnight. You are encouraged to extend these exercises with additional features to explore the material, however, know that some exercises build on previous ones. You can collaborate with other students, but you must submit your own work. You will submit what you believe the grade you achieved is on the assignment, reflect on what you learned, and answer other associated questions about the assignment. Your work may be subject to peer review.

### Labs

Labs serve multiple purposes in this course. You will often complete short exercises during lab that you will be due by the stated deadline. If you are unable to attend lab you are still expected to submit the activity by the deadline. You have until midnight on the day of the lab to submit. You can collaborate with other students, but you must submit your own work. You will submit what you believe the grade you achieved is on the assignment, reflect on what you learned, and answer other associated questions about the assignment. Your work may be subject to peer review.

### Homework

Homework are programming assignments that reinforce material taught in class. These are longer assignments and take more time than in-class exercises. They require you to apply your understanding of the material to a programming challenge that emphasizes what you have learned during lecture and any assigned material. You can collaborate with other students, but you must submit your own work. You will submit what you believe the grade you achieved is on the assignment, reflect on what you learned, and answer other associated questions about the assignment. Your work may be subject to peer review.

### Team Project

The team project encompasses the last third of the semester - approximately 4 weeks. You will be required to work in a team of 3-4 students to design and implement a web application using the three important components of web applications including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The design and implementation of the application is entirely up to you, but it must solve a real-world problem, be connected to work you have done in other areas (general education), connect to your discipline (e.g., CS, Informatics) and be relatively unique as compared to other existing applications (within reason). You are allowed to use any technology as long as it relates to the material covered in class and adheres to the project requirements. Your work is subject to peer review.

### Assignment Submission

Assignments will be submitted electronically. You are responsible for submitting your assignments by the assigned due date. The due dates for assignments will be clearly indicated on the schedule and it is your responsibility to update your own calendar so you are aware of due dates.

## Late and Early Submissions

### Lateness General Guidelines

Lateness is defined as any assignment that is outside of the stated due date requirements. We allow assignments to be submitted three days “late” after the posted due date. However, penalties might be applied (see Submission Currency below). After the three days we will not accept a submission from any assessment component. It is your responsibility for maintaining your own schedule and being prompt with your submissions. We expect that you become familiar with the course submission software and verify that your submission has been properly uploaded. We will not accept late submissions due to lack of checking on this. We assume:

- You are an adult and have the ability to check and verify your work has been received properly.
- You are capable of using GitHub, DropBox, Google Drive, or some other backup software to ensure that your work is not lost in the event of a computer failure.
- You have a back-up plan in place in the event that your computer fails or your internet connection is unavailable. Make sure you have a plan B and C if your computer crashes or your internet is unavailable. This is your responsibility.
- To ensure that you submit projects on time you should begin them early and not wait until the last minute to submit. You will be able to submit multiple times so submit early and often to ensure you have something in before the deadline.

If there are extenuating circumstances beyond your control that prevent you from completing an assignment by the posted deadline you must contact the instructor immediately using the appropriate communication channel (see Communication below).

### Submission Currency 💵

To add some flexibility to submission deadlines, we will be using a form of “currency” in this course to earn “tokens” for submissions that are made before the day an assignment is due. If you submit an assignment before the deadline you will receive a token. You may then use a token to buy a late day allowing you to submit an assignment past the deadline. If you submit an assignment late and you run out of tokens, you may borrow tokens putting you in the negative. To get out of the hole you will need to submit subsequent assignments early to earn tokens back and pay your debt!

If you complete the course with leftover tokens it will be applied to your final grade and increase your overall grade for the course. If you complete the course with negative tokens it will be applied to your final grade and decrease your overall grade for the course.

**Here are the rules:**

- You start the course with 3 tokens.
- If you submit an assignment any day before or on the day an assignment is due you will receive a token.
- If you submit an assignment any day after the day an assignment is due you will pay a token for each day past the due date.
- You may only use tokens up to three days past the deadline of an assignment. After three days past the deadline you are no longer able to use tokens or submit an assignment late. It will be marked as missing with a 0.
- You can only earn a maximum of 5 tokens.

**Examples:**

- At the start of the semester Mia submits the first assignment two days early and receives a token increasing their purse to 4.
- In the middle of the semester Pat is late by 2 days. This uses 2 tokens from their purse. This is not bad since Pat hasn’t missed an assignment. Pat has 1 token remaining.
- At the end of the semester Jorge has 3 tokens and their grade is an 88. The tokens are applied and their final grade is a 91. Jorge is happy. 😃
- At the end of the semester Tanya has -2 tokens and their grade is a 90. The tokens are applied and their final grade is an 88. Tanya is unhappy 😔, but understands.

You are ultimately responsible for maintaining your token count. We will do our best to calculate the number of tokens you have for each assignment. However, it may take a few days to do so.

**Tokens may not be used or gained on in-class exercises or labs.**

## Final Grades

To evaluate your understanding of the course content, we will use scores achieved on each of the above assessment components. Your final grade will convey what you know from the course and how well you know it. Missing assignments can have a dramatic impact on your final grade so it is important that you are attentive to submission deadlines and avoid any missing work. The typical breakdown of percentages and final grades for this course are A (93-100), A- (90-92), B+ (87-89), B (83-86), B- (80-82), C+ (77-79), C (73-76), C- (70-72), D+ (67-69), D (60-66), F (0-59). This grading scheme may be adjusted based on the overall performance of students in the course.

## Communication

- **Email:** Email should not be used. Please post privately to Instructors on Piazza (see below). In the unlikely event that you are unable to post to Piazza, please send an email to the instructor teaching your course section.

- **Piazza:** We will be using Piazza for all other communication. This online discussion forum should be your first choice for asking questions. You should check the discussion forum before asking your question to see if the same question has already been posted. We will not answer questions that have already been answered in the discussion forum. Think before you post. We expect you to do a reasonable amount of thinking to try to solve your problems before posting for help. Make sure you are articulate and clear with your post (i.e., think before you post). You should post questions related to assignments early rather than wait until the last minute. Questions that are posted very near an assignment deadline may not be answered. Course staff are expected to answer questions Monday through Friday. Do not expect prompt answers on Saturday, Sunday, and scheduled holidays and breaks.

    **Please post with respect and kindness. Posts that are disrespectful, crude, inappropriate, or mean will not be tolerated and will be reported and result in your immediate removal from the course and a failure for the course.**

- **Lecture:** You are welcome to ask questions during and after class. The course will reserve 15 minutes after class to answer any questions. After that 15 minutes you will need to remember your question and ask it on Piazza.

## Course Support

### Office Hours

Office hours are times when we provide real-time access to the instructor, TAs, and UCAs. You do not need an appointment to attend office hours, attendance is optional, and all questions you have about the course are welcome. These sessions will be held at several different times during the week. Office hours will be posted on the course website.

### Accommodations

The University of Massachusetts Amherst is committed to providing an equal educational opportunity for all students. If you have a documented physical, psychological, or learning disability on file with Disability Services (DS), you may be eligible for reasonable academic accommodations to help you succeed in this course. If you have a documented disability that requires an accommodation, please notify me as soon as possible so that we may make appropriate arrangements.

### Title IX

If you have been the victim of sexual violence, gender discrimination, or sexual harassment, the university can provide you with a variety of [support resources](http://www.umass.edu/titleix/node/448) and accommodations. UMass is committed to providing these resources with minimal impact and costs to survivors on a case-by-case basis. Resources are available to survivors with or without them filing a complaint. No upfront costs are charged to any currently enrolled students for University Health Services or the Center for Counseling and Psychological Health, and no fees exist for services in the Dean of Students Office, the Center for Women and Community, Student Legal Services, or by live-in residential staff.

## Attendance and Participation

You are expected to attend class and lab regularly, read any assigned readings before class, and participate in class discussions and activities. Your participation will be evaluated in a variety of ways. This includes any in class activities or activities that may be given during class or lab sections. You are responsible for maintaining your own schedule and ensuring that you are present during these activities and/or complete them in a timely manner. It is generally not possible to make up missed work.

## Course Incompletes

Students who are unable to complete course requirements within the allotted time because of severe medical or personal problems only may request a grade of Incomplete from the instructor of the course. Incomplete grades are warranted only if a student is passing the course at the time of the request and if the course requirements can be completed by the end of the following semester. Furthermore, an incomplete will be granted if at least 75% of the work has been completed for the course. Otherwise, the recommended course of action is to withdraw and retake the course in the future. Please see the Academic Regulations Section IV Grading System and Credit Guidelines for further details.

**Note: an incomplete means you are on your own to complete the material agreed upon by the instructor of this course. Do not expect additional help or one-on-one teaching of the material past the course completion date. It is your responsibility to complete the remaining material.**

## Collaboration Policy

1. **Group Work Encouragement:** Students are encouraged to work in groups to facilitate learning, knowledge sharing, and skill development. Group work will be a regular part of the course and students are expected to actively participate in it. **Group work is allowed on all assignments in this course.**
2. **Individual Submissions:** Although group work is encouraged, each student is required to submit their own individual work based on the group collaboration. This is to ensure that each student is held accountable for their own learning and understanding of the course material.
3. **Group Responsibilities:** All group members are expected to contribute equally to the group discussions and work and should be prepared to share their knowledge and skills with their peers. Group members should also be respectful of each other's opinions and work styles.
4. **Conflict Resolution:** In the event of a conflict within the group, students are encouraged to communicate and resolve the issue amongst themselves. If the conflict cannot be resolved, the instructor will mediate.
5. **Credit Allocation:** Credit for group work will be allocated based on each student's individual contribution to the assignment. Students will assess their own contributions to submitted assignments and determine their grades accordingly.
6. **Cheating:** Cheating, including plagiarism, is not tolerated and will result in a failing grade for the assignment. All work submitted must be original and should accurately reflect the student's own understanding of the course material.
7. **Communication:** Regular communication between group members is essential for successful collaboration. Students are encouraged to use online tools, such as email or group chat platforms, to stay in touch and communicate effectively.

By following this collaboration policy, students will be able to work collectively while still being held accountable for their individual learning and understanding of the course material.
