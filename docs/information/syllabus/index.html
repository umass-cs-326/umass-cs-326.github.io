heading">​</a></h2><p>The web is arguably today&#x27;s most important application platform. Web browsers run on practically every device, and even many phone applications are in fact web applications under the covers. This course will cover a broad range of client-side web technologies, including HTTP itself, HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript; it will additionally cover key concepts for the server side of web applications, including key value stores and SQL servers. This course will also cover key concepts and technologies including AJAX, JavaScript libraries (e.g., jQuery), and web security. This course is hands-on and heavily project-based; students will construct a substantial dynamic web application based on the concepts, technologies, and techniques presented during lectures and in readings. This course satisfies the IE Requirement.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="prerequisites">Prerequisites<a class="hash-link" href="#prerequisites" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>COMPSCI 220 (or 230) with a grade of C or better, or INFO 248 and COMPSCI 186/187, with a grade of C or better in each. This course assumes a good understanding of programming at the 187 (data structure implementation) or 186 level (using data structures), basic command line usage, understanding of version control systems (e.g., git), and object-oriented programming concepts and techniques are helpful. Previous JavaScript background, while not required, is also helpful. We also assume a level of maturity for success in working in a team-based environment.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="statement-of-inclusivity">Statement of Inclusivity<a class="hash-link" href="#statement-of-inclusivity" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>The staff for this course support the UMass commitment to diversity, and welcome individuals regardless of age, background, citizenship, disability, sex, education, ethnicity, family status, gender, gender identity, geographical origin, language, military experience, political views, race, religion, sexual orientation, socioeconomic status, and work experience. In this course, each voice in the classroom has something of value to contribute. Please take care to respect the different experiences, beliefs and values expressed by students and staff involved in this course.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="required-text">Required Text<a class="hash-link" href="#required-text" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>No required text.

Generally, most of what we cover in this course is available on all the typical operating systems. However, the team project allows you to explore additional environments that may have specific OS requirements. You are welcome to use those additional libraries/tools; however, you will not receive direct support for what you use. It is your responsibility for the installation, setup, and use of those additional components. You are welcome to use any editor, IDE, or tools to explore this material. We strongly recommend that you use <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Visual Studio Code</a>.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="other-material">Other Material<a class="hash-link" href="#other-material" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>It is assumed that you have a computer to use for assignments in this course. You should make sure to commit your work frequently to GitHub. We will not accept excuses for missing or accidental deletion of work. You may only use GitHub for storing your work on individual assignments if you are using a private repository. Use of public repositories to store assignment solutions on GitHub is considered cheating and will result in a failure for this course. You will be required to store and share your team project work on a public repo!</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="learning-outcomes">Learning Outcomes<a class="hash-link" href="#learning-outcomes" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>After this course, students will be able to:</p><ul><li>Apply HTML to structure content rendered in a browser</li><li>Apply CSS to style content in a browser to enhance the usability of an application</li><li>Apply the JavaScript programming language to solve problems in a web environment</li><li>Apply the fundamental architecture of a front-end web application</li><li>Apply the fundamental architecture of a back-end web application</li><li>Apply the connection between front-end and back-end</li><li>Apply a RESTful web application</li><li>Apply the fundamental construction of a modern and complete web application</li></ul><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="integrative-experience">Integrative Experience<a class="hash-link" href="#integrative-experience" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>This course satisfies the Integrative Experience (IE) requirement. The upper-division integrative experience provides a structured context for students to reflect on their own learning and explore the connections between the broad exposure provided by General Education and the more focused exposure of their major. You can read additional details on the integrative experience website. The IE requirement is fulfilled by this course through the application of extensive team-based learning. Furthermore, this course embraces the IE through a substantial team project that is entirely student driven and explicitly integrates the material covered in this course with the experiences, learning, and knowledge attained by every unique person enrolled in this course.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="course-format">Course Format<a class="hash-link" href="#course-format" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="hybrid">Hybrid<a class="hash-link" href="#hybrid" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>This course uses a hybrid model.

During the section that you are not enrolled in, you are expected to attend on Zoom. If you have a conflict with the time of the other section, you are then expected to watch the recording of the class on your own time and complete any activity that was introduced during class. If you attend on Zoom, you will be able to ask questions by posting to the messaging system.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="lectures">Lectures<a class="hash-link" href="#lectures" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>Lectures will be led by the professor and provide a high-level overview of the course material. The presentation format will include a variety of slides, written notes, programming examples, activities, etc. All material will be available through the course learning management system site or website. You are expected to attend every lecture for your section and arrive promptly so you do not disturb others. You may use electronic devices during class, however, its use must pertain to the activity at hand. If your use of an electronic device is distracting to yourself or others, you will be asked to turn the device off.</p><p><strong>What happens if I can’t attend a lecture in person?</strong></p><p>Although we want you to attend the lecture for your section in person, we understand that sometimes that isn’t always possible.

In an ungraded environment, teachers provide regular and ongoing feedback to students on their progress and learning, rather than assigning a final grade at the end of a course or assignment. This approach empowers students to take ownership of their learning by encouraging them to set their own goals, reflect on their progress, and engage in self-assessment. By removing the pressure of grades, students are able to take risks, be creative, and collaborate with their peers, leading to deeper and more meaningful learning experiences. Additionally, ungrading can help to reduce the stress and anxiety that students often experience in a traditional graded environment and foster a positive learning culture in the classroom.</p><p>This course uses ungrading. In short, the responsibility of the grade you achieve in this course is up to you. You will submit grades that you believed you achieved on each and every assignment in this course including the final project and final grade. We will choose at random some number of submissions where we will provide feedback, but no grade. You will be asked to submit an extensive self-reflection at two points during the semester on your own learning and evidence that supports that learning. We will evaluate these submissions and how they relate to your chosen grade to determine accuracy.</p><p>At the end of the course, you will submit a grade that you believe accurately reflects your learning in this course. The instructor reserves the right to make modifications to your grade based on your submissions and reflections. </p><p>This form of grading provides grade freedom and ownership in your own learning. If used wisely, you have the opportunity to learn without grade stress and experience a learning environment that is free and open. We trust that you will use this freedom to explore the course material and beyond in ways in which you may not have been able to otherwise.</p><blockquote><p>&quot;The path to true learning lies not in grades but in the journey of self-discovery. Let go of the pressure, and the knowledge will come.&quot; - Yoda</p></blockquote><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="assignments">Assignments<a class="hash-link" href="#assignments" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="exercises">Exercises<a class="hash-link" href="#exercises" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>Most classes will provide time to begin exercises that will apply your understanding of the material being discussed in lecture. You are required to complete participation exercises by the stated deadline. If you are unable to attend class you are still expected to submit the activity by the deadline. They are due on the day of the next class by midnight. You are encouraged to extend these exercises with additional features to explore the material, however, know that some exercises build on previous ones. You can collaborate with other students, but you must submit your own work. You will submit what you believe the grade you achieved is on the assignment, reflect on what you learned, and answer other associated questions about the assignment. Your work may be subject to peer review.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="labs">Labs<a class="hash-link" href="#labs" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>Labs serve multiple purposes in this course. You will often complete short exercises during lab that you will be due by the stated deadline. If you are unable to attend lab you are still expected to submit the activity by the deadline. You have until midnight on the day of the lab to submit. You can collaborate with other students, but you must submit your own work. You will submit what you believe the grade you achieved is on the assignment, reflect on what you learned, and answer other associated questions about the assignment. Your work may be subject to peer review.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="homework">Homework<a class="hash-link" href="#homework" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>Homework are programming assignments that reinforce material taught in class. These are longer assignments and take more time than in-class exercises. They require you to apply your understanding of the material to a programming challenge that emphasizes what you have learned during lecture and any assigned material. You can collaborate with other students, but you must submit your own work. You will submit what you believe the grade you achieved is on the assignment, reflect on what you learned, and answer other associated questions about the assignment. Your work may be subject to peer review.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="team-project">Team Project<a class="hash-link" href="#team-project" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>The team project encompasses the last third of the semester - approximately 4 weeks. You will be required to work in a team of 3-4 students to design and implement a web application using the three important components of web applications including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The design and implementation of the application is entirely up to you, but it must solve a real-world problem, be connected to work you have done in other areas (general education), connect to your discipline (e.g., CS, Informatics) and be relatively unique as compared to other existing applications (within reason). You are allowed to use any technology as long as it relates to the material covered in class and adheres to the project requirements. Your work is subject to peer review.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="assignment-submission">Assignment Submission<a class="hash-link" href="#assignment-submission" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>Assignments will be submitted electronically. You are responsible for submitting your assignments by the assigned due date. The due dates for assignments will be clearly indicated on the schedule and it is your responsibility to update your own calendar so you are aware of due dates.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="late-and-early-submissions">Late and Early Submissions<a class="hash-link" href="#late-and-early-submissions" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="lateness-general-guidelines">Lateness General Guidelines<a class="hash-link" href="#lateness-general-guidelines" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>Lateness is defined as any assignment that is outside of the stated due date requirements. We allow assignments to be submitted three days “late” after the posted due date. However, penalties might be applied (see Submission Currency below). After the three days we will not accept a submission from any assessment component. It is your responsibility for maintaining your own schedule and being prompt with your submissions. We expect that you become familiar with the course submission software and verify that your submission has been properly uploaded. We will not accept late submissions due to lack of checking on this. We assume:</p><ul><li>You are an adult and have the ability to check and verify your work has been received properly.</li><li>You are capable of using GitHub, DropBox, Google Drive, or some other backup software to ensure that your work is not lost in the event of a computer failure.</li><li>You have a back-up plan in place in the event that your computer fails or your internet connection is unavailable. Make sure you have a plan B and C if your computer crashes or your internet is unavailable. This is your responsibility.</li><li>To ensure that you submit projects on time you should begin them early and not wait until the last minute to submit. You will be able to submit multiple times so submit early and often to ensure you have something in before the deadline.</li></ul><p>If there are extenuating circumstances beyond your control that prevent you from completing an assignment by the posted deadline you must contact the instructor immediately using the appropriate communication channel (see Communication below).</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="submission-currency-">Submission Currency 💵<a class="hash-link" href="#submission-currency-" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>To add some flexibility to submission deadlines, we will be using a form of “currency” in this course to earn “tokens” for submissions that are made before the day an assignment is due. If you submit an assignment before the deadline you will receive a token. You may then use a token to buy a late day allowing you to submit an assignment past the deadline. If you submit an assignment late and you run out of tokens, you may borrow tokens putting you in the negative. To get out of the hole you will need to submit subsequent assignments early to earn tokens back and pay your debt!</p><p>If you complete the course with leftover tokens it will be applied to your final grade and increase your overall grade for the course. If you complete the course with negative tokens it will be applied to your final grade and decrease your overall grade for the course.</p><p><strong>Here are the rules:</strong></p><ul><li>You start the course with 3 tokens.</li><li>If you submit an assignment any day before or on the day an assignment is due you will receive a token.</li><li>If you submit an assignment any day after the day an assignment is due you will pay a token for each day past the due date.</li><li>You may only use tokens up to three days past the deadline of an assignment. After three days past the deadline you are no longer able to use tokens or submit an assignment late. It will be marked as missing with a 0.</li><li>You can only earn a maximum of 5 tokens.</li><li>To use your tokens you must use our token request form available on the course LMS.</li></ul><p><strong>Examples:</strong></p><ul><li>At the start of the semester Mia submits the first assignment two days early and receives a token increasing their purse to 4.</li><li>In the middle of the semester Pat is late by 2 days. This uses 2 tokens from their purse. This is not bad since Pat hasn’t missed an assignment. Pat has 1 token remaining.</li><li>At the end of the semester Jorge has 3 tokens and their grade is an 88. The tokens are applied and their final grade is a 91. Jorge is happy. 😃</li><li>At the end of the semester Tanya has -2 tokens and their grade is a 90. The tokens are applied and their final grade is an 88. Tanya is unhappy 😔, but understands.</li></ul><p>You are ultimately responsible for maintaining your token count. We will do our best to calculate the number of tokens you have for each assignment. However, it may take a few days to do so.</p><p><strong>Tokens may not be used or gained on in-class exercises or labs.</strong></p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="final-grades">Final Grades<a class="hash-link" href="#final-grades" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>To evaluate your understanding of the course content, we will use scores achieved on each of the above assessment components. Your final grade will convey what you know from the course and how well you know it. Missing assignments can have a dramatic impact on your final grade so it is important that you are attentive to submission deadlines and avoid any missing work. The typical breakdown of percentages and final grades for this course are A (93-100), A- (90-92), B+ (87-89), B (83-86), B- (80-82), C+ (77-79), C (73-76), C- (70-72), D+ (67-69), D (60-66), F (0-59).
