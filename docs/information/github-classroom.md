**We will be using GitHub Classroom to distribute and collect assignments.**

GitHub Classroom is a web-based platform for educators to manage and track student assignments. It integrates with GitHub, the popular code hosting and collaboration platform, to provide a streamlined and efficient workflow for educators and students.

For a web programming class, GitHub Classroom is particularly useful because it allows educators to set up and distribute assignments, track student progress, and provide feedback all within one platform. Students can access their assignments and submit their work directly on GitHub, providing an easy-to-use environment for both the students and the educator.

With GitHub Classroom, educators can also ensure that each student has a unique repository for their work, which can be used to keep track of changes and version history. This makes it easier to review and provide feedback on student work and helps to avoid potential conflicts or merge conflicts.

Additionally, GitHub Classroom provides a convenient and secure way for students to submit their work, and provides a platform for peer review, where students can see the code of their classmates and learn from it. This can foster a collaborative learning environment and encourage students to engage with each otherâ€™s work.

Overall, GitHub Classroom is a valuable tool for web programming classes because it provides a simple and effective solution for managing student assignments and tracking progress, while also promoting collaboration and encouraging learning through peer review.
