    "description": "Homework are programming assignments that reinforce material taught in class. These are longer assignments and take more time than in-class exercises. They require you to apply your understanding of the material to a programming challenge that emphasizes what you have learned during lecture and any assigned material. You can collaborate with other students, but you must submit your own work. You will submit what you believe the grade you achieved is on the assignment, reflect on what you learned, and answer other associated questions about the assignment. Your work may be subject to peer review."
