## Overview
In this exercise you will make a full chess board (8x8) that uses a css grid and changes colors as you hover, revealing the text, and the text indicates which piece is at the relevant position:

"rook", "knight", "bishop", "queen", "king", "bishop", "knight", "rook", "pawn"

When you click on a square, it will print to the console the coordinates of the square:
