## Overview

The following exercises will give you some practice with some of the basics of the JavaScript programming language. You should write your solutions in VSCode (or an editor of your choice).

## Starter Code

You are provided a single HTML file named `exercise-04.html`. Although we haven’t discussed HTML files yet, you will write your JavaScript code between the `<script>` tags inside of that HTML file. You may only use the [console.log](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/console/log) function to print values to the browser’s console and [console.assert](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/console/assert) to test the functions that you write. You are encouraged to test your code to make sure it works as intended.

## TODO #1: Letter Frequency

Write a function letterFrequency that counts the number of times a particular character appears in a string and returns that count. You'll need to use the length property of a string (str.length → the length of the string). Note that the string is represented as an array, so you can access each character by normal array indexing: str[0] is the first character.

You will find **TODO #1** in the `exercise-04.html` file. 

## TODO #2: Palindrome Detector

Write a function isPalindrome that checks if the input string is a palindrome – that is, the string is the same forwards and backwards (example: *level* is a palindrome, as is the word *racecar* and *tacocat*). This function returns *true* if the word is a palindrome; false otherwise. For this exercise, "race car" (with a space) is not a palindrome, but "a a a" is.

You will find **TODO #2** in the `exercise-04.html` file.
