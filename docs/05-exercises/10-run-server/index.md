You are provided a single file: **server.js**. This JS file contains a rudimentary example of how an HTTP server is written using the core HTTP library that the node environment provides. It is a highly efficient HTTP server designed to write server-side web applications in JavaScript.

You can install Node.js by [visiting their website](https://nodejs.org/en/download/). There are several different ways to get node on your local computer. Determine which way is the best for you. After you install node, bring up a terminal and type in this command: \



```
node --version
```

Take a screenshot of your terminal. You will submit this as part of this exercise.

Run the HTTP server like so:


```
node server.js

Take a screenshot of your terminal. You will submit this as part of this exercise.
