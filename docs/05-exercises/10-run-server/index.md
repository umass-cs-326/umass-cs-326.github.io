You are provided a single file: **server.js**. This JS file contains a rudimentary example of how an HTTP server is written using the core HTTP library that the node environment provides. It is a highly efficient HTTP server designed to write server-side web applications in JavaScript.


# TODO #1: Install Node.js

You can install Node.js by [visiting their website](https://nodejs.org/en/download/). There are several different ways to get node on your local computer. Determine which way is the best for you. After you install node, bring up a terminal and type in this command: \



```
node --version
```


 \
Take a screenshot of your terminal. You will submit this as part of this exercise.


# TODO #2: Run the HTTP server.

Run the HTTP server like so:


```
node server.js
```


 \
Take a screenshot of your terminal. You will submit this as part of this exercise.

You must do the following to submit this assignment:



* A screenshot of the version of node you installed in your terminal
