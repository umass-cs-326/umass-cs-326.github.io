---


# Overview

In this exercise, you will make a mini-checkerboard (2x2) that uses CSS grid layout and changes colors as you hover over the grid elements:

**This exercise does not require you to use any code from a previous exercise.**

The application works as follows:



* The user can hover over a block and the block turns red and displays the word “hello” in white text.


# Starter Kit

:::note

Follow the GitHub Classroom assignment link on Moodle first.

:::

You are provided two files: **mini-checkerboard.html** and **mini-checkerboard.css**. Both of these files are mostly empty. Your job is to fill them in to create this 2x2 checkerboard application.


# TODO #1: User Interface

This part is really easy. Do the following:



1. Add a **&lt;div>** element to mini-checkerboard.html file to represent the entire 2x2 board. You should also have a class and id attribute for this div so your CSS rules can apply rules to it. This will be the container for your 2x2 grid.
2. Add child **&lt;div>** elements to the above **&lt;div>** to represent each of the squares. You should also have a class attribute for these as well.

You will find **TODO #1** in the **mini-checkerboard.html** file.


# TODO #2: Application Interactivity

Next, add the CSS rules to duplicate the behavior of the application displayed above. You are not allowed to use JavaScript in this application.

You will find **TODO #2** in the **mini-checkerboard.css** file.
