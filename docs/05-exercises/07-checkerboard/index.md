**This exercise does not require you to use any code from a previous exercise.**

The application works as follows: 

- The user hovers over a block and the block turns red and displays the word “hello” in white text.

# Starter Kit

:::note

Follow the GitHub Classroom assignment link on Moodle first.

:::

You are provided two files: `mini-checkerboard.html` and `mini-checkerboard.css`. Both of these files are mostly empty. Your job is to fill them in to create this 2x2 checkerboard application.

## TODO #1: User Interface

This part is really easy. Do the following:

1. Add a `<div>` element to `mini-checkerboard.html` file to represent the entire 2x2 board. You should also have a `class` and `id` attribute for this div so your CSS rules can apply rules to it. This will be the container for your 2x2 grid.
2. Add child `<div>` elements to the above `<div>` to represent each of the squares. You should also have a class attribute for these as well.

You will find **TODO #1** in the `mini-checkerboard.html` file.

## TODO #2: Application Interactivity

Next, add the CSS rules to duplicate the behavior of the application displayed above. You are not allowed to use JavaScript in this application.

You will find **TODO #2** in the `mini-checkerboard.css` file.
