# B01 Git and GitHub Basics

## Overview

In this lab we will go over the basics of how to use Git and GitHub for version control. Version control will ensure you have a solid working history for any code you write and will allow you to easily revert your work if something goes wrong (It happens to all of us!).

Git becomes especially important when working on teams of software engineers like you will for the team project later in the semester. Organizing and merging together the work of multiple people is not easy and knowing how to properly use Git will make your lives a lot easier.
