# Labs

The lab sections are led by teaching assistants (TAs) for this course. There will also be undergraduate course assistants (UCA) and/or Head UCAs assigned to your lab section. You are expected to attend every lab section. Labs are used to begin lab exercises in groups as well as to work on the end of semester project. Missing a lab section does not excuse you from any activities that occur during that time. Do not ask to make up any missed work during lab section time.
