# Git Setup

Building web applications inevitably leads to the creation of many different files including JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and more. To keep track of those files an important part of web development is using a version control system (VCS). In this course, we will be using a very popular VCS known as Git. If you are unfamiliar with Git, do not worry! It doesn't take much time to get familiar with the basic commands and workflow. In this course, you will learn how to use Git to manage your code by using it for every assignment and project. As you work through homework, you will become increasingly familiar with how it is used and by the end of this course feel confident that you can use it for your future projects. We will also be using GitHub to store our Git repositories in the cloud and we will use it extensively for distributing assignments.

## Preparation

Before you complete the tasks in this document, you should watch the following videos:

- [Git, GitHub, & GitHub Desktop for beginners](https://youtu.be/8Dd7KRpKeaE)
- [Git and GitHub in ~30 Minutes](https://youtu.be/jG4Vs81kMlc)

The first video provides a gentle introduction to Git using GitHub Desktop, which is a graphical application that allows you to interface with Git repositories stored on GitHub. The second video covers the most common Git commands that can be used from a command prompt. Although you can use GitHub Desktop for much of the work in this course, you should use Git from the command line to better understand how it works. To be proficient with Git and claim that you understand how it is used and works (say, in a job interview), you should be able to use Git from the command prompt.

## Download and Install Git

Download and Install Git. After you install Git, open a command prompt on your operating system ([Terminal on Mac](https://www.howtogeek.com/682770/how-to-open-the-terminal-on-a-mac/), [Command prompt on windows](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/a-beginners-guide-to-the-windows-command-line/), [Terminal on Linux](https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/command-line-for-beginners#3-opening-a-terminal)) and type in the following command:

```bash
git --version
```

This will print out the version. Mine looks like this:

```bash
git version 2.38.1
```

## Create a GitHub Account

[Create an account on GitHub](https://github.com/signup) if you do not already have a GitHub account.
