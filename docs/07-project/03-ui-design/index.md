## Starter Kit

There is no starter kit. Use your project repository from the previous project assignment.

## Objective

The aim of this project assignment is to design an intuitive and user-friendly front-end user interface for a web application. You will create a wireframe of the user interface and develop stories that illustrate how the interface will work and what its functionality is.

## Tasks

### Task #1: Setup

Create new directories in your git repository called `docs` and `docs/ui-design`. The latter directory will contain all of your UI design files. You will also need to create a new Markdown file called `docs/ui-design/index.md`. This file will contain a write-up of your UI design. You can use the following template to get started:

```markdown
# UI Design

## Wireframe

Facilis quas ut iste nam et. Doloribus ut nostrum nobis ut ut eos quia vel soluta. Minus dolorem error neque voluptas ex.

![Wireframe 1](wireframe-1.png)

Consequuntur reiciendis illo non suscipit necessitatibus dolores doloribus sed atque. Quos rem excepturi ut eum et eaque facere et. Illo quos voluptatem ratione sint numquam dolor assumenda. Ea et et sapiente distinctio et aut aspernatur necessitatibus est.
 
Est velit debitis enim. Esse et et quos animi animi. Quibusdam et porro et praesentium maiores dolores facilis. Voluptas molestias sapiente aperiam culpa. Et doloribus maiores omnis quisquam dolores.
 
Esse est et ut rem et praesentium quibusdam eaque. Aut consectetur illum placeat repellendus nam. Exercitationem dolorem tempora.

Qui commodi beatae. Quaerat saepe tempora nisi labore ducimus corporis adipisci repellat nihil. Dolores est sed ratione consequatur est magnam cupiditate. Repellendus molestias qui doloribus. Deserunt quidem temporibus. Sunt hic laudantium vitae natus est.

## Stories

### Task #2: Wireframe Design

Develop a wireframe design for your application's front-end user interface. You can use any wireframing tool of your choice. Some popular wireframing tools include [Figma](https://www.figma.com/), [Whimsical](https://whimsical.com/wireframes), [Gimp](https://gimp.org/), [Wireframe.cc](https://wireframe.cc/), and [Draw.io](https://app.diagrams.net/). Ensure that your design is visually appealing, easy to navigate, and user-friendly.

### Task #3: Story Development

Create stories that will guide users on how to interact with your application. These stories should illustrate the functionality of your application and how the user interface will work. Use diagrams, screenshots, or any other visual aid to help you tell the story.

### Task 4: HTML & CSS Mockup

Your team must also create a polished web interface with HTML and CSS code. We are highly encouraging you to use [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) for the layout of your HTML elements. You can also include some JavaScript code to polish up some animations and user interaction. Put any HTML & CSS code for these pages in your main repository and include screenshots of your HTML pages inside your milestone Markdown file docs/milestone1.md.

## Deliverables

- A wireframe design for your application's front-end user interface.
- A set of stories that illustrate the functionality of your application and how the user interface will work.
- An HTML & CSS mockup of your application's front-end user interface.

## Grading

You will self score your project based on the following criteria:

- Creativity and originality of the design
- Clarity and effectiveness of the stories
- User-friendliness of the interface
- Quality of the wireframe design
- Quality of the HTML & CSS mockup
- Quality of your write-up

The following gives you an idea on how to assign a score to your submission:

- **exceeding expectation**: Your submission is above and beyond what was expected. You went above and beyond to create a unique and original design, your stories are clear and effective, your interface is user-friendly, your wireframe design is of high quality, your HTML & CSS mockup is of high quality, and your write-up is well written and easy to understand. You also included additional features/aspects in your submission that were not required or mentioned for this assignment.
- **meeting expectation**: Your submission meets the requirements of the assignment. You created a unique and original design, your stories are clear and effective, your interface is user-friendly, your wireframe design is of high quality, your HTML & CSS mockup is of high quality, and your write-up is well written and easy to understand.
- **approaching expectation**: Your submission is close to meeting the requirements of the assignment. You may have created a unique and original design, your stories are not entirely clear and effective, your interface is user-friendly but is not entirely complete or friendly in all aspects, your wireframe design is of medium quality, your HTML & CSS mockup is of medium quality, and your write-up is possibly well written and easy to understand. However, there are issues with your submission. One or several of the above criteria are not met, the quality of your submission is not high enough, aspects of your submission are incomplete or unclear.
- **below expectation**: Your submission is below the requirements of the assignment. You may have created a unique and original design, your stories are not clear and effective, your interface is not user-friendly, your wireframe design is of low quality, your HTML & CSS mockup is of low quality, and your write-up is not well written and easy to understand. However, there are issues with your submission. Several of the above criteria are not met, the quality of your submission is not high enough, aspects of your submission are incomplete or unclear. This is not considered a submission that is expected at the college level.
- **unable to evaluate**: no submission, minimal changes, nothing to evaluate.

- There are not specific restrictions on the number of wireframes you should create. However, you should be able to explain your design choices and how your wireframes will guide users on how to interact with your application.

- There are not specific restrictions on the number of HTML & CSS mockups you should create. However, you should be able to explain your design choices and how your mockups will guide users on how to interact with your application.

## Reviewing

We will select a number of submissions to review and provide feedback on. We will also provide feedback on the submissions that are below expectation. We will not provide feedback on submissions that are exceeding. We will review your work based on your self-assessment and the feedback you provide in the project reflection survey. We will determine if we agree or disagree with your self-assessment and provide feedback on your submission and a suggested score that may be different from your self-assessment. However, we will not change your self-assessment. You will be responsible for deciding if you agree or disagree with our feedback and if you want to change your self-assessment at the end of the semester.

## Version Control (Git)

Each team member must make at least one commit to the repository for
this project milestone. You must also push your changes to GitHub
before the due date. We recommend using a Git workflow to coordinate
work on the project between team members. We recommend the [GitHub
Flow](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/github-flow)
as a light-weight workflow, however, you are welcome to use any
workflow you are comfortable with and your team agrees to.

Whichever workflow you choose, however, we expect that you will be
using *pull requests* (PR). You will want to use links to pull
requests as evidence of your contributions in the reflection survey.
