## Information

- Visit Moodle and follow the GitHub Classroom assignment link.
- See the [calendar](/docs/information/schedule/#project) for due
  dates.

Remember, you are responsible for managing your own calendar. Please
add an entry to your calendar with the due date for this assignment.

## Submission

You must submit the following to complete this assignment:

1. **Team Submission** Push all changes to your GitHub repository
   before the due date. You do not need to submit anything to
   Moodle. We will take your last commit before the deadline as your
   submission. All team members must add commit, and push to the
   repository. We will ask you about your contributions in the Grade
   Reflection survey, so be prepared to provide evidence of your
   contributions. See the [Version Control](#version-control-git)
   section below for additional information and requirements.
2. **Individual Submission:** Complete the Grade Reflection survey
   associated with this assignment on Moodle. You will be asked to
   reflect on your team's performance and your individual
   contributions to the project. Everyone on the team must complete
   the survey. You will be asked to provide evidence of your
   contributions to the project.

## Starter Kit

:::note

Follow the GitHub Classroom assignment link on Moodle first. You will
find your team in a list of teams. Choose your team from the
list. Your team will be using the same repository for each project
assignment.

:::

We provide you with a base repository for your team project. There
isn't much in the base repository, but it does contain a
`README.md`. You will need to update this file with your team's
information and a description of your project. You will also need to
update the `LICENSE` file with the license you choose for your
project.

## Overview

This project milestone will give your team an opportunity to describe
an innovative idea for a web application that your team will be
developing over the latter half of this semester. In addition, your
team will design some preliminary functionality of the application to
show us what you expect your final application will be capable of
doing.

Naturally, we expect your thoughts and ideas for your project to
change during the course of the semester leading to changes in the
data your application will support and the interface your users will
expect. This and all future projects will be building blocks leading
to the final project submission at the end of the semester. To get a
sense of where your project should be headed, please read the Final
Project Specification to understand the requirements for the final
submission.

## Project Ideas Document

Your team must come up with an original and innovative idea for a web
application. Your idea can be something entirely new or it can be
based off of an existing application but targeting a completely
different user base.

Your application must include at least four different types of data
(excluding user data (e.g., username, email, avatar)). For example, an
image viewer application that supports only images is not
acceptable. A cookbook application that includes data for recipes,
ingredients, shopping lists, user comments, and likes is acceptable.

You must add to the `README.md` file in your repository a description
of your application and how it relates to other existing
applications. If your application does not relate to an existing
application then mention that. In particular, you must include the
following information in your `README.md` file:

- The team name (as it appears in the Google Team Sign up Sheet)
- The application name (something creative)
- The first section titled **Team Overview** includes the names of
  each team member and their GitHub usernames.
- The second section titled **Innovative Idea** provides a brief
  paragraph or two describing your application and how it relates to
  other existing applications. If your application does not relate to
  an existing application then mention that.
- The third section titled **Data** provides a list of the data your
  application will support. For each data type, you must include a
  brief description of the data and how it will be used in your
  application. For example, if you are creating a recipe application,
  you might have a data type for recipes. You would then describe what
  a recipe is and how it will be used in your application. You must
  include at least four different types of data (excluding user data
  (e.g., username, email, avatar)).
- The fourth section titled **Functionality** provides a list of the
  functionality your application will support. For each functionality,
  you must include a brief description of the functionality and how it
  will be used in your application. For example, if you are creating a
  recipe application, you might have a functionality for adding a
  recipe. You would then describe how a user would add a recipe to
  your application. You must include at least four different types of
  functionality.
- The fifth section titled **License** includes the license you choose
  for your project. You must choose a license from the [Open Source
  Initiative](https://opensource.org/licenses) and include a link to
  the license in your `README.md` file. You must also include a copy
  of the license in your repository (`LICENSE`). For example, if you
  choose the MIT license, you would include the following in your
  `README.md` file:

    ```markdown
    [MIT License](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)
    ```

    and you would include a copy of the license in your repository.

## Version Control (Git)

Each team member must make at least one commit to the repository for
this project milestone. You must also push your changes to GitHub
before the due date. We recommend using a Git workflow to coordinate
work on the project between team members. We recommend the [GitHub
Flow](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/github-flow)
as a light-weight workflow, however, you are welcome to use any
workflow you are comfortable with and your team agrees to.

Whichever workflow you choose, however, we expect that you will be
using *pull requests* (PR). You will want to use links to pull
requests as evidence of your contributions in the reflection survey.
