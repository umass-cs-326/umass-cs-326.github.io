# Project

## Overview

The team project starts on the first day of class with forming teams. You will be working in a team of 4 students to design and implement a web application using the three important components of web applications including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The design and implementation of the application is entirely up to you, but it must solve a real-world problem, be connected to work you have done in other areas (general education), connect to your discipline (e.g., CS, Informatics) and be relatively unique as compared to other existing applications (within reason). You are allowed to use any technology as long as it relates to the material covered in class and adheres to the project requirements. Your work is subject to peer review.

## Project Specification

There are 5 project milestones leading up to the [project showcase](./showcase) on the last day of class. Each project milestone will lead you towards the final project submission. As part of this, you will need to keep in mind the requirements for the final project submission and the specific technologies we require.

## Specifications and Requirements

Here are the specifications that the final project submission will need to support:

- **Innovative Idea:** Your application should be an innovative idea that is unique. This does not mean you need to have a radically different web application UI, database, etc.; rather, it can be an application that may exist, but targets a different set of users than an existing web application. The most important part is that your team's project must be different from any other team.
- **Front End:** Your application must support a user interface designed and built using HTML and CSS. The application may use HTML/CSS frameworks for developing the UI such as [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/). We have found that Bootstrap is the easiest to work with given its wealth of documentation and tutorials. We strongly recommend you use Bootstrap. If you wish to use other libraries, please ask first. Other frameworks like React/Angular or similar libraries are not allowed.
-  **Back End:** Your application must support a JavaScript-based server. In particular, you must use a [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/) backend that provides data storage and processing functionality to the front-end of the site.
- **Data and Communication:** Your application must store and retrieve data from the server. That is, it should at a minimum support CRUD (creation, reading, updating, and deletion) of data that will be used and displayed as part of your UI. This data must not only include user information, but also data supported by the application and user experience. For example, in a Facebook-type application, this would include posts, replies, likes, images, social network data, and so on. It should be clear in your submission what this data is and why it is important to the user.
- **User Interactivity** Your application must support user interactivity. Users should be able to view data as well as modify aspects of that data. Your application may include the ability to interact with other users as well. You should do this via JavaScript/HTTP or Web Sockets.
- **Dynamic UI:** The interactivity on your website must include an element of in-place HTML modification. You cannot only use HTML forms & templates for your interaction.
- **Authentication:** Your application must include login/logout functionality. This means that you will be required to support user authentication and authorization. If your application doesn't maintain any personal data, you should have a members only section that is only accessible by logged in users.
- **Deployment:** Your application must be deployed to a hosting service. All reviews will be done by testing and examining the code for the publicly-accessible website. You should be deploying your code publicly from day one. **This may be removed if we are unable to find a hosting site that is freely available to students.**

## Project Topics

Your group is welcome to propose most application ideas as long as they are respectful of everyone, adhere to the syllabus' equality statement, and in general, meet the overall expectations of university work. The general idea is that it is a data-driven website covering the specifications mentioned above.

In addition, your project must not rely on any operating system specific components. That is, it must run entirely in the browser (front-end) and be implemented entirely using the NodeJS framework (back-end). You may use third-party NodeJS libraries that can be installed via npm, but they must be supported on all operating systems.

## Milestone Schedule

The milestones are scheduled logically front-to-back: you are expected to work on front-end HTML/CSS first, then front-end JavaScript, then back-end Node.js (also in JavaScript). Everyone must be involved in every milestone.

- Project Milestone 1: Join a Team
- Project Milestone 2: Project Ideas
- Project Milestone 3: UI Design
- Project Milestone 4: Front End
- Project Milestone 5: Back End

Please see the project due dates in the [schedule](../information/schedule#project).

## Grading

- **Milestones:** Each milestone will have an associated reflection survey that will be used to evaluate team's performance and will be used to determine a grade for that milestone. The survey will be available on Moodle. You will propose a grade for each team member (including yourself) based on their performance. The course staff will use this information to inform the final grade for each team member. The course staff will also review the code and functionality of the project to determine the final grade.
- **Final Submission:** Each team member will submit a reflection survey on their experience working on the project. This survey will be used to evaluate the team's performance and will be used to determine your final grade for the project. The survey will be available on Moodle. You will propose a grade for each team member (including yourself) based on their performance. The course staff will use this information to inform the final grade for each team member. The course staff will also review the code and functionality of the project to determine the final grade.
