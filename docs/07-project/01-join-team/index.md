# Pr1: Join a Team

**Objective:** To form a team of four members for the class project
and ensure effective communication among team members.

**Instructions:**

- Use Piazza and in-class discussions to find team members who share
  similar interests and goals.
- Add your UMass email address to a Google Sheet that is provided by
  the instructor. A link to the sheet can be found under the
  **Project** section in Moodle.
- Your team will be used for the class project, and possibly for some
  of the exercises and homework. Therefore, it is important to have a
  functioning team that can work together efficiently.
- We will be using Git and apply a Git workflow to manage shared
  repositories for the project and some assignments.
- You must fill in the required information in the Google Sheet by the
  deadline. The deadline can be found on the
  [schedule](../../information/schedule/#project).

The deadline to form a team and submit the Google Sheet is [insert
deadline].

**Note:** If you are unable to find a team by the deadline, follow the
instructions in the google sheet.

*Remember, working in a team is an essential part of the learning
process, and it will help you develop skills such as communication,
collaboration, and time management. So, make sure to choose your team
members wisely and work together to achieve your goals. Good luck!*
