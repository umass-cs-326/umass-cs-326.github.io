# L02 JavaScript Intro

## Overview

JavaScript is one of the most popular scripting languages in the world today. It was first released in 1995 by Netscape and Sun Microsystems as a way to make web pages more interactive and dynamic. It has been a fundamental component of web browsers since then and continues to be an integral part of todayâ€™s websites and applications.

One of the main strengths of JavaScript is its ease of use, making it a popular choice for both professional and hobbyist web developers alike. It has also seen major improvements in its syntax, and with new versions of JavaScript such as ES6 and ES7, the language is now more robust and full featured than ever before. In addition to its core scripting capabilities, it is also well-known for its ability to manipulate the DOM (Document Object Model) which allows developers to update the appearance of websites and applications in the browser.

On the downside, JavaScript has been notorious for the presence of errors and the difficulty in debugging. It can be particularly challenging to debug in older browsers as they can produce obscure error messages, making debugging a headache.

Despite this, JavaScript has had an impressive and impressive history. Its origins can be traced back to the Scheme programming language, a subset of the Lisp programming language, and its subsequent rise to prominence as the language of choice for scripting browsers was driven by its versatility and relatively easy learning curve.

In conclusion, JavaScript is an incredibly versatile and powerful language. While it is prone to the occasional errors and can be difficult to debug, its features and flexibility make it an attractive choice for web developers and application developers alike.
