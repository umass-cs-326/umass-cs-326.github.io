# Lectures

Lectures will be led by the professor and provide a high-level overview of the course material. The presentation format will include a variety of slides, written notes, programming examples, activities, etc. All material will be available through the course learning management system site or website. You are expected to attend every lecture for your section and arrive promptly so you do not disturb others. You may use electronic devices during class, however, its use must pertain to the activity at hand. If your use of an electronic device is distracting to yourself or others, you will be asked to turn the device off.
