If you are unfamiliar with Git, do not worry! It doesn\'t take much time to get familiar with the basic commands and workflow. In this course, you will learn how to use Git to manage your code by using it for every assignment and project. As you work through homework, you will become increasingly familiar with how it is used and by the end of this course feel confident that you can use it for your future projects. We will also be using GitHub to store our Git repositories in the cloud and we will use it extensively for distributing assignments.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"guides/index":{"id":"guides/index","title":"Guides","description":"","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"guides/vscode/index":{"id":"guides/vscode/index","title":"VSCode","description":"There are many wonderful programming editors that are available.
